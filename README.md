  - on tablet shows a Log of the plays being made
  - plays sound when playeeer wins , makes bad play and some other cases
  - buttons have material design features
  - the timer if ON uses an Async task to check wether the player has run out of time or not
  - the game has its own logic and keeps tack of the player/AI pieces and turns
  - the contextual menu lets the user view all the games the selected player has played
  - or delete that game or send it through mail
  - some files remain just to show the coding even if they are not used they can be repurposed
  - both the game screen and the database viewing screen are independant of the Activity (to a certain degree)
